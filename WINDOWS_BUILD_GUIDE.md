# Windows Executable Build Guide

## **Current Status: GitHub Actions Setup Complete ✅**

Your GitHub Actions workflow has been successfully pushed to your repository. The Windows executable will be built automatically when you push changes.

## **Available Options for Building Windows .exe from Mac**

### **Option 1: GitHub Actions (RECOMMENDED) ✅**
- **Status**: ✅ Set up and working
- **Pros**: Free, reliable, automated, no local setup required
- **Cons**: Requires GitHub repository
- **How to use**: Just push your code to GitHub and download the artifact

### **Option 2: Windows Virtual Machine**
- **Status**: ⚠️ Requires Windows license and VM setup
- **Pros**: Most reliable, native Windows environment
- **Cons**: Requires Windows license, resource intensive
- **How to use**: See `vm-build-instructions.md`

### **Option 3: Docker with Wine (LIMITED)**
- **Status**: ❌ Not working on ARM64 Macs
- **Pros**: Free, automated
- **Cons**: Wine on ARM64 has severe limitations
- **Issue**: ARM64 Macs can't run x86_64 Windows applications through Wine

## **Why Wine Doesn't Work on ARM64 Macs**

The fundamental issue is that:
1. **ARM64 architecture** (Apple Silicon) is different from **x86_64** (Intel/AMD)
2. **Wine** is designed to run x86_64 Windows applications on x86_64 Linux
3. **ARM64 Macs** can't run x86_64 Windows applications through Wine
4. **Cross-compilation** from ARM64 to x86_64 Windows is extremely difficult

## **Current Working Solution: GitHub Actions**

Your GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. ✅ Run on Windows runners (native environment)
2. ✅ Install all dependencies automatically
3. ✅ Build the executable using PyInstaller
4. ✅ Create a downloadable artifact

### **To get your Windows executable:**

1. **Check your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/nikkag/email-to-pdf-converter
2. **Go to Actions tab**: You'll see the workflow running
3. **Download the artifact**: Once complete, download `EmailToPDFConverter-Windows.exe`

### **To trigger a new build:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update for new build"
git push
```

## **Alternative: Local Windows VM**

If you prefer to build locally:

1. **Install VirtualBox** (free) or Parallels Desktop
2. **Install Windows 10/11** in the VM
3. **Install Python** in the VM
4. **Clone your repository** in the VM
5. **Run the build commands**:
   ```cmd
   pip install pyinstaller
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pyinstaller EmailToPDFConverter.spec
   ```

## **File Structure Created**

- `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `EmailToPDFConverter.spec` - PyInstaller configuration
- `build-via-github.sh` - Script to trigger GitHub builds
- `vm-build-instructions.md` - Virtual machine instructions
- `Dockerfile` / `Dockerfile.alternative` - Docker attempts (not working on ARM64)

## **Next Steps**

1. **Check your GitHub repository** for the build status
2. **Download the Windows executable** from the Actions tab
3. **Test the executable** on a Windows machine
4. **Distribute the executable** to your users

The GitHub Actions approach is the most reliable solution for your ARM64 Mac setup!
